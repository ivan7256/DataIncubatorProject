Having Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a life long endeavor. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by a lack of production of insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, specifically, beta cells are in charge of signaling its production. Insulin is what helps the body maintain our glucose levels stable. Thus, when we don’t have enough production of insulin, the glucose levels in our bodies remain high (hyperglycemia) which can lead to major health problems and in non treated cases, to death. However, when your pancreas still produces beta cells, which can be measured by a C-peptide level test, one could be able to manage glucose levels without insulin. Such is my case. 

Managing T1D without insulin is not an easy endeavor and should not be done without the supervision of an endocrinologist. However, it is not impossible. The first step to manage T1D, is to know you the glucose levels of your body. Glucose levels data can be acquired through a glucometer. The normal fasting glucose measurement range is 70-120 mg/dL. Being in this range, indicates a good management of your glucose. 

The major cause for an increase in glucose levels is intake of food containing sugars or the ones that our body will convert into sugars, such as: carbohydrate, starch, maltose, lactose and so on. Thus, whenever we eat a meal containing sugars, our body will need to take care of it. However, we should remember that our body uses as source of energy glucose and ketones. Thus, it is also important to have a certain intake of source of energy, to keep our bodies above the lower range of normal glucose levels. 

Glucometers contain powerful data for diabetes management. If we look deeper into the numbers glucometers provide us, we can better identify the sources for increase in glucose. As previously mentioned, food containing sugar will be the main source for this increase. However, other factors such as stress, exercise, infections, cortisol, can also influence glucose levels.  Moreover, continuous glucometers provide great information on how changes of glucose in your body are occurring without the need of testing.  

Spikes in glucose are of importance, since this causes a risk of organ damage. Both a sharp increase or decrease of your glucose can damage your health. Sharp decreases of glucose are usually cause by overdose of insulin. Without a continuous measurement of glucose, we might have an incorrect trend of our glucose and dose accordingly. For example, our glucose might be starting to lower when we are at 180 mg/dL, nonetheless we might think it is increasing and make use of insulin. This will lead to a sharp drop of glucose and an event of low glucose (hypoglycemia) which is usually treated with intake of sugar, thus incurring in an increase of glucose and starting the cycle again. Altogether, continuous glucometers provide knowledge of our glucose trends.

So far, we know continuous glucometers (CGM) provide valuable information. But, how can we use it further?  The next step, in my experience and by taking to the  T1D community, is to look at what specific food causes your increase in glucose. However, this is a very difficult task and requires having a lot of energy, log keeping, remembering what we ate and so on. Thus, the goal of this project is to use a data driven approach to help the T1D community improve their diabetes management. 

The project you’ll find here, will help you to get insight into your day to day glucose levels. Specifically, I aim to :

Aim 1. Provide a data driven approach to estimate average trends of glucose

•	Upload user glucose data and get information on glucose levels

Aim 2. Detect sharp glucose spike events to give insight into the cause of the event.

•	Detection of risky spikes through analysis of glucose levels
•	Log intake of food
•	Indicate repetition of risky spikes and specific food intake during risky spike events

Aim 3. Provide an App for the T1D community for improving management of diabetes. 

•	Automized app that provides valuable information to diabetics about their food intake and risky spikes.
•	Addition of correlation of other factors leading to risky spikes (e.g. cortisol, fasting, stess).
